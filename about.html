        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>
          SCS MENA was founded and is led by senior practitioners with extensive
          experience delivering complex forensic investigations, market-entry analysis,
          and business intelligence projects across MENA and globally. Before launching
          SCS MENA, the founders helped establish and lead MENA-focused forensic and
          intelligence practices within Big Four professional services environments,
          building and managing multidisciplinary teams across reputational risk, market
          intelligence, country risk, and growth strategy. Their work has covered multiple
          industries, including oil and gas, banking, and asset management, supporting
          clients operating in higher-risk markets and complex regulatory landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The founding team has also held senior roles within tier-1 global banks and
          high-growth fintechs, where they built and led risk, advisory, and complex
          investigations functions. This operator-level experience underpins a strong
          understanding of financial crime risk and compliance frameworks, including
          AML/CFT expectations, sanctions exposure, third-party risk, and governance
          controls. In 2020, the founders joined forces to establish SCS MENA as a
          political risk, business intelligence, and corporate investigations consultancy,
          combining experienced intelligence professionals with deep local insight to
          deliver decision-grade country and sector analysis and practical risk advisory
          in fast-evolving environments.
