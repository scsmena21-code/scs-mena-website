        <article class="card">
          <p>SCS MENA was founded and is led by senior practitioners with extensive experience delivering complex forensic investigations, market-entry analysis, and business intelligence projects across the MENA region and globally. Prior to launching SCS MENA, the founders helped establish and lead MENA-focused forensic and intelligence practices within Big Four professional services environments, building and managing multidisciplinary teams spanning reputational risk, market intelligence, country risk, and growth strategy. Their work has covered multiple industries, including oil and gas, banking, and asset management, supporting clients operating in higher-risk markets and complex regulatory landscapes.</p>
          <p>The founding team has also held senior roles within tier-1 global banks and high-growth fintechs, where they built and led risk, advisory, and complex investigations functions. This operator-level experience underpins a strong understanding of financial crime risk and compliance frameworks, covering areas such as AML/CFT expectations, sanctions exposure, third-party risk, and governance controls. In 2020, the founders joined forces to establish SCS MENA as a political risk, business intelligence, and corporate investigations consultancy, bringing together experienced intelligence professionals with deep local insight to deliver decision-grade country and sector analysis and practical risk advisory for clients navigating fast-evolving environments.</p>
